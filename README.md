# Coursera-MachineLearning-Stanford-Python
This is my solution to all the programming assignments and quizzes of Machine-Learning (Coursera) taught by Andrew Ng in Python Language. This course is mainly taught in Matlab/Octave, however I have implemented the solutions in Python using Numpy. After completing this course you will get a broad idea of Machine learning algorithms. Try to solve all the assignments by yourself first, but if you get stuck somewhere then feel free to browse the code for Python Implementations..
